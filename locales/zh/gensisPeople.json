Made possible by a unique assembly of 8 art talents, Genesis People encapsulates their ingenious understanding about ‘people’. It marks a prelude to metaverse and epitomizes a symposium on man’s inner self. Genesis People will take on 3D forms to meet the potential of metaverse. It aims at creating a brief history of mankind via sculptural medium.",
  "GENSIS_PEOPLE_SECTION_ARTWORK_TITLE": "Ever-growing Artwork",
  "GENSIS_PEOPLE_SECTION_ARTWORK_DESC": "Genesis People comes in form of skeletons. They are the artistic expression, echoing the collection’s theme of the human history. Genesis People takes ‘people’ as its motif, alluding to ‘growth’ as a characteristic of ‘man’. As metaverse evolves, Genesis People runs in parallel and draws strong momentum therefrom. Meanwhile, the artists will empower Genesis People with new elements featuring ‘growth’, creating derivative sculptures to highlight their bonds with metaverse.",
